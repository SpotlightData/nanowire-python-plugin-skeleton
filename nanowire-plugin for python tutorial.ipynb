    "This is a guide to using the nanowire plugin to develop custom plugins for the nanowire data processing system. The nanowire system works by creating a server which performs some user function on code passed to it. The result of the user code is then passed to the next plugin in the pipeline.\n",

    "In this system the function to be turned into a plugin becomes an individual dockerised server which examines a rabbitMQ queue waiting for information to become avalible on the queue. When an object is queued on the apropriate rabbitMQ queue the plugin takes the object off the queue and passes it to the queue for the next plugin in the pipeline. In this way multiple plugins can be chained together to produce a workflow."

    "This is necessary since all nanowire plugins are run as self contained servers from within docker containers. You will now need to convert the processing you require into a single main function that takes \"nmo\", \"jsonld\" and \"url\" as arguments. The nmo is a system tool containing information such as the filename and job id, the jsonld is the tool which contains the data produced by previous plugins in the pipeline (this will be None if it is the first plugin in the pipeline) and url is the minio link to a file to be processed. This is used in instances such as image processing plugins. An example skeleton for your plugin is shown below:-"
